# Participant Instructions
## Human-AI Interaction Study

---

### Welcome!

Thank you for participating in our research study on human-AI collaboration. This study explores how people work with AI assistants at different levels of automation.

---

### What You'll Do

You will solve **4 logic puzzles** about seating arrangements. Each puzzle will be presented with a different level of AI assistance:

1. **Solo Mode** - You solve the puzzle completely on your own
2. **Advisor Mode** - The AI suggests a solution, you decide whether to accept it
3. **Supervisor Mode** - The AI solves automatically, but you can intervene if needed
4. **Observer Mode** - The AI handles everything, you just observe

---

### Time Required

- **Total time:** 20-30 minutes
- Each puzzle takes approximately 3-5 minutes

---

### How to Participate

1. **Open the experiment website:**
   - You will receive a link from the researcher
   - Works best in Chrome, Firefox, or Safari

2. **Enter your Participant ID:**
   - You will be given a code like "P001" or "P012"
   - This code is anonymous and keeps your data private

3. **Read each LOA introduction carefully:**
   - Before each puzzle, you'll learn about that level of automation
   - Take your time to understand how to interact

4. **Solve the puzzles:**
   - Read the puzzle description carefully
   - Pay attention to all constraints
   - Follow the instructions for each automation level

5. **Answer brief questions:**
   - After each puzzle, you'll answer 2-3 quick questions
   - These ask about your confidence, trust, and awareness

6. **Complete the final questionnaire:**
   - At the end, you'll be directed to a short survey
   - This takes about 3-5 minutes

---

### Tips for Success

✅ **Read carefully** - The puzzles have multiple constraints

✅ **Think logically** - Work through each clue step by step

✅ **Trust your judgment** - If the AI's answer seems wrong, it might be!

✅ **Take your time** - There's no rush, accuracy is more important than speed

✅ **Be honest** - In the questionnaires, share your true feelings

### What We're Studying

We're interested in:
- How different levels of AI automation affect your trust in the system
- Whether you stay aware of what the AI is doing
- How automation impacts your productivity and decision quality

---

### Your Rights

- ✅ **Voluntary** - You can stop at any time
- ✅ **Anonymous** - No personal information is collected
- ✅ **Confidential** - Your data is kept secure
- ✅ **No risk** - This is a low-risk study

### Sample Puzzle

Here's what a puzzle looks like:

> **Example:**
> Three people (Alice, Bob, Charlie) are sitting in a row.
> - Alice is not at either end
> - Bob is to the left of Charlie
> 
> **What is the seating order from left to right?**
>
> *Answer: Bob, Alice, Charlie*
