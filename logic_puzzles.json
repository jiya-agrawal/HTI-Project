Also, Eva is adjacent to Aditi, so Eva must be either immediately clockwise or counterclockwise. Try placing Eva immediately counterclockwise (… Eva, Aditi, …); then the person immediately clockwise of Aditi is Dev, giving Aditi → Dev → Ben and satisfying the two-seats-left rule. Clara must be directly opposite Dev in a 6-seat circle, so Clara is three seats away from Dev. That forces Farhan into the remaining seat, and we get the order Aditi, Dev, Ben, Farhan, Clara, Eva. Check: Aditi is two seats left of Ben (Aditi–Dev–Ben); Eva is next to Aditi; Farhan is two seats from Eva (Eva–Aditi–Dev–Ben–Farhan); Clara is opposite Dev; and Ben is not adjacent to Clara.
